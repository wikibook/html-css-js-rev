        <p><span class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.</p>
